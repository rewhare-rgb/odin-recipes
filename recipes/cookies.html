    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) dark/light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup (185g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped dark/milk chocolate</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the unsalted butter in a saucepan until it foams and browns (5–8 minutes). Let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Whisk all-purpose flour and baking soda in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine light/dark brown sugar and granulated sugar with browned butter. Use an electric mixer to beat until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Mix in 1 egg and 1 tsp. vanilla extract on medium-high speed until the mixture lightens and thickens.</li>
        <li>Reduce mixer speed, add dry ingredients, and beat to combine. Mix in chopped chocolate by hand.</li>
        <li>Let dough sit for 30 minutes to hydrate; it will thicken.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C), line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>        
        <li>Portion dough into balls on the baking sheet, leaving space between. Don't flatten; cookies will spread.</li>
        <li>Bake until edges are golden brown and centers are soft (9–11 minutes).</li>
        <li>Let cookies cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

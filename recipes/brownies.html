    <h4>Try this homemade brownie recipe when you need a decadent chocolate fix! They're fudgy and chewy in the middle, with melty chocolate bits in every bite — and the edges are addictively crisp. Plus, they're so simple to make that you'll never go back to boxed mixes again!</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter (226g)</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar (400g)</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder (75g)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (120g)</li>
        <li>1½ cups semisweet chocolate chips (270g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8×8-inch baking pan with baking spray and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter in the microwave in 20-second intervals stirring between each one until fully melted, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar and cocoa and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. Whisk in the eggs, vanilla, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and chocolate chips and mix together with a spatula until just combined. Spread the batter into the prepared pan. (You can sprinkle the top with more chocolate chips, if desired.)
        </li>
        <li>Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes, inserting a toothpick into the center to check doneness, and removing it with several moist crumbs for fudgy brownies or only a few crumbs for cakey brownies. Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before slicing.
        </li>

    </ol>

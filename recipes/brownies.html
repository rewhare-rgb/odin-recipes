    <p>This exceptional brownie recipe stands out as the ultimate choiceâ€”packed with fudgy, gooey, and intensely chocolatey goodness that's absolutely irresistible. And here's the best part: crafting these brownies is just as effortless as using a boxed mix, but the flavor is a league above.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar (200g)</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar (200g), lightly packed</li>
        <li>3 eggs room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cocoa powder (75g)</li>
        <li>1 cup flour (120g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt (6g)</li>
        <li>1.5 cup dark chocolate chips (260g)</li>
        <li>1 cup melted butter (225g), unsalted</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coffee (15mL)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract (15mL)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and prep a 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine melted butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and coffee then mix together well.
        </li>
        <li>Add the white and brown sugars to the mixture and whisk together well.
        </li>
        <li>Sift cocoa powder, flour, and salt into the bowl and mix until just combined
        </li>
        <li>Toss in chocolate chips (or chunks) and fold into the batter.</li>
        <li>Add batter to pan and smooth to the edges. You can add more chocolate chips to the top before baking if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 30 minutes or until the center is just set. You'll notice the center does not wiggle when the pan is moved.</li>        
    </ol>
